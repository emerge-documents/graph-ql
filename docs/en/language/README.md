# 2 Language

Clients use the GraphQL query language to make requests to a GraphQL service. We refer to these request sources as documents. A document may contain operations (queries and mutations are both operations) as well as fragments, a common unit of composition allowing for query reuse.

A GraphQL document is defined as a syntactic grammar where terminal symbols are tokens (indivisible lexical units). These tokens are defined in a lexical grammar which matches patterns of source characters (defined by a double‚Äêcolon ::).
